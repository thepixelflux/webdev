Exploring and trying my hands on HTML and CSS that includes:
Build a basic webpage using only HTML including my introduction, list of interests,my weekly schedule, favorite books/movies,hyperlink to your favorite website and usage of  subscript and superscript.
Create a styled HTML file and a Mini Portfolio Page using both HTML and CSS containing my introduction, my profile image, the Project i would like to persue in near future, skill/tool I am looking forward to learn.
